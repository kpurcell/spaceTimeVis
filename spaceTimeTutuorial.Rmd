## Horizonplots



```{r}
library(rfisheries)
library(plyr)
countries <- of_country_codes()
# let's take a small subset, say 5 random countries
c_list <- countries[sample(nrow(countries), 5),]$iso3c
# and grab landings data for these countries
results <- ldply(c_list, function(x) {
    df <- of_landings(country = x)
    df$country  <-  x
    df
}, .progress = 'text')

res <- dcast(results)

```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
